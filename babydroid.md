# Challenge Desccription
This challenge will take you on a journey through a series of checks, each holding a piece of the puzzle. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate these checks and unveil the hidden flag.
# Approach
We just need to use jadx to extract the contents of it.

In the source code I found recruitment.android.decryptme.

Then I navigated to it and found "a" file it it, then I opened it.

I tried to understand the code and after a few attempts i got a basic idea of what it was trying to say and understood it.

# Flag found
p3nt35t{droid_Enigma_@sc3nd_21wsmkla10o}
